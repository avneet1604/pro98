Whenever the magnetic flux linked with an electric circuit changes, an emf is induced in the circuit. This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction.

Faradayâ€™s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction

(i) Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an induced emf is produced in it.

(ii) The induced emf lasts so long as the change in magnetic flux continues.

(iii) The magnitude of induced emf is directly proportional to the rate of change in magnetic flux, i.e.,
